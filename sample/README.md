# Sample Threat Model

This directory contains a sample model that uses the CEMT to evaluate a generic system, with a focus on an Insider Threat misuse case. You can use [CAMEO Systems Modeler](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/no-magic/cameo-systems-modeler/) to open the `.mdzip` file and explore the model.
