# Cyberworthiness Evaluation and Management Toolkit (CEMT)

## Background

CEMT is a tool for developing cyberworthiness assessments of complex systems. It has been created as part of a Higher Degree by Reserach (HDR) through the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra to address the need for a consistent and comprehensive approach for assessing the cyberworthiness of complex systems within the Australian Government Department of Defence. Traditional cybersecurity assessment methodologies that leverage lists of mitigation strategies that have been compiled from historical best practice are important tools for hardening engineered systems, but their usefulness is limited when applied to bespoke systems that do not share the same operational profile or environmental context of the systems from which these best practices were derived. The CEMT provides a first-principles approach to evaluating the cyberworthiness of a system, facilitating a transparent and explainable risk assessment which inherently scoped to the context of the system being evaluated. This delivers a comprehensive justification that can underpin a claim of cyberworthiness with the necessary level of engineering assurance.

### Cyberworthiness

Cyberworthiness is the ability for a system to continue to operate safely and effectively in a contested cyber environment. Given this explicit focus on continued operation, it has an inherent bias towards ensuring the integrity and availability of the system and its functions when faced with a cyber threat.

The inclusion of the worthiness construct is a reference to the established technical assurance frameworks that underpin concepts such as airworthiness and seaworthiness. This requires a level of rigour in the engineering analysis that provides confidence and assurance that the claim of worthiness is accurate, complete and supported by evidence. The primary guiding principles that were adopted for the development of the CEMT are based on the *Principles for Governance of Seaworthiness* from the [Defence Seaworthiness Management System Manual](https://www.defence.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-01/SeaworthinessMgmtSystemManual.pdf):

> 2.10 The seaworthiness governance principles require that seaworthiness decisions are made:
> 
> a. **mindfully** – decisions are more effective and less likely to have unintended consequences when they are made with a thorough understanding of the context, the required outcome, the options available, and their implications now and in the future
>
> b. **collaboratively** – obtaining input from all stakeholders and engaging in joint problem-solving results in better decisions (bearing in mind that collaboration does not necessarily require consensus)
> 
> c. **accountably** – decisions only become effective when people take accountability for making them happen
>
> d. **transparently** – decisions are more effective when everyone understands what has been decided and why.

CEMT approaches cyberworthiness from the perspective that the overall objective is to create a cybersecurity evaluation for mission critical and safety critical systems that are mindful of the context in which the system is operating, is intuitive enough to facilitate collaboration between all stakeholders, is understandable by key decisions makers so that they can reasonably take accountability for their decisions and is transparent in terms of how the conclusions trace to the analysis.
